brazen this out
shoot those off
sketch these out
blow it up
vote that through
at first blush
chop those off
give these up
be not amused
do him in
leave behind this leave this behind
hold on to
someone would n't touch those with a ten-foot pole
pension this off
plug that in that into
reel these out
coop him up
blaze a trail
throw those back in your face
let us be
something or other
